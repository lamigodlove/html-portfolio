  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name's Lami Godlove and I am a Web Designer, Digital Marketing Specialist and now a Web Developer.
    After going through Angela's web developer bootcamp, she has handed me the web development skills I've always dreamed about in a platter of gold.
    Please <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a> now because I can wait to share with you the websites I have been able to build from scratch and how these websites can benefit your own business or create a business for you if you don't yet have one.
